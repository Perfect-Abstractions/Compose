# Key Concepts
Core-Concepts:
  - ERC-2535 Diamonds: Diamond standard for modular smart contracts
  - Facets: Modular smart contract components
  - Smart Contract Oriented Programming (SCOP): Programming paradigm designed specifically for smart contracts
  - Composition Over Inheritance: Combine deployed facets instead of inheriting contracts
  - On-Chain Standard Library: Verified, audited facets deployed on multiple blockchains

# Philosophy
Philosophy:
  - Read First: Code written to be understood first, not just executed
  - Diamond-Native: Built specifically for ERC-2535 diamond contracts
  - Composition Over Inheritance: Combine facets instead of inheriting contracts
  - Intentional Simplicity: Banned features lead to clearer, safer code
