<DocSubtitle>
This section contains the guidelines and rules for developing new facets and Solidity libraries in **Compose**. We focus on building small, independent, and easy-to-understand facets. Each facet is designed to be deployed once, then reused and composed seamlessly with others to form complete smart contract systems.

:::warning[Early Development]
Compose is still in early development and currently available only to contributors.
It is not **production-ready** — use it in test or development environments only.
