<DocSubtitle>
Manages diamond ownership and transfers.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Permissioned ownership control for administrative functions.
- Supports safe transfer of ownership to prevent accidental loss of control.
- Allows for complete renouncement of ownership.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerFacet provides essential functionality for managing the ownership of a Compose diamond. It allows for querying the current owner, transferring ownership to a new address, and renouncing ownership entirely. This facet is crucial for controlling administrative actions within the diamond.

## Storage

### OwnerStorage

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={15} title="Definition">
{`struct OwnerStorage {
    address owner;
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

### State Variables

## Functions

### getStorage

Returns a pointer to the owner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getStorage() internal pure returns (OwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable

    {
      name: "s",
      type: "OwnerStorage",
      description: "The OwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

### owner

Get the address of the owner

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() external view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "-",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the owner."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### transferOwnership

Set the address of the new owner of the contract Set _newOwner to address(0) to renounce any ownership.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable

    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

## Errors

      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerFacet} from "@compose/diamond/facets/Owner/IOwnerFacet.sol";

contract OwnerCaller {
    IOwnerFacet private immutable _ownerFacet;

    constructor(address _diamondAddress) {
        _ownerFacet = IOwnerFacet(_diamondAddress);
    }

    function callOwner() external {
        address currentOwner = _ownerOwner();
        // Example: Transfer ownership if allowed
        // _ownerFacet.transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }

    function _ownerOwner() internal view returns (address) {
        return _ownerFacet.owner();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Ensure the OwnerFacet is initialized with the correct owner address during diamond deployment.
- Use `transferOwnership` to delegate administrative control safely.
- Consider the implications of `renounceOwnership` as it makes the diamond unmanageable by any single address.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Access control is paramount. Only the current owner can execute `transferOwnership` and `renounceOwnership`. Ensure that the address performing these actions is indeed the rightful owner to prevent unauthorized control of the diamond. Input validation is handled by the `transferOwnership` function, which reverts if `_newOwner` is the zero address, except when explicitly intended for renouncement.
