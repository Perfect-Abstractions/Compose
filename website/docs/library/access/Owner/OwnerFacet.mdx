Manage contract ownership and transfer.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Manages the single owner of the diamond.
- Supports secure transfer of ownership to a new address.
- Allows the owner to completely renounce ownership.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerFacet provides essential ownership management functionalities for a Compose diamond. It allows the current owner to view the owner's address, transfer ownership to a new address, or renounce ownership entirely. This facet is fundamental for controlling administrative actions within the diamond.

## Storage

### OwnerStorage

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={15} title="Definition">
{`struct OwnerStorage {
    address owner;
}`}

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import { IOwnerFacet } from "@compose/access/Owner/IOwnerFacet";
import { OwnerFacet } from "@compose/access/Owner/OwnerFacet";
import { DiamondCutFacet } from "@compose/diamond/DiamondCutFacet";
import { Diamond } from "@compose/diamond/Diamond";

contract DeployOwnerFacet {
    address internal constant OWNER_FACET_STORAGE_POSITION = keccak256("compose.owner");

    function deploy() public {
        // Assume diamond is already deployed and initialized
        Diamond diamond = Diamond(msg.sender); // Replace with actual diamond address

        // Deploy the OwnerFacet
        OwnerFacet ownerFacet = new OwnerFacet();

        // Prepare diamond cut to add the OwnerFacet
        // This assumes you have a way to get the facet cut data
        // For demonstration, we'll just show how to add it
        address[] memory facetAddresses = new address[](1);
        facetAddresses[0] = address(ownerFacet);

        bytes[] memory functionSelectors = new bytes[](4);
        functionSelectors[0] = OwnerFacet.owner.selector;
        functionSelectors[1] = OwnerFacet.transferOwnership.selector;
        functionSelectors[2] = OwnerFacet.renounceOwnership.selector;
        functionSelectors[3] = OwnerFacet.getStorage.selector; // Internal function for storage pointer

        // In a real deployment, you'd use DiamondCutFacet to add facets
        // DiamondCutFacet(diamond.getFacetAddress(diamond.DIAMOND_CUT_FACET_ID)).diamondCut(
        //     new Diamond.FacetCut[](
        //         1
        //     ),
        //     address(0), // clear all old facets
        //     encodedSelectorsToClear
        // );

        // Example of calling owner function after deployment
        // IOwnerFacet ownerFacetInterface = IOwnerFacet(diamond.getFacetAddress(diamond.OWNER_FACET_ID)); // Assuming owner facet has a known ID
        // address currentOwner = ownerFacetInterface.owner();
        // ownerFacetInterface.transferOwnership(address(1));
    }
}
`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize the OwnerFacet during diamond deployment or upgrade to set the initial owner.
- Ensure that only the current owner can call `transferOwnership` and `renounceOwnership`.
- Store the OwnerFacet's storage in its designated slot (`keccak256("compose.owner")`) to prevent conflicts with other facets.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Access control is critical. Only the current owner should be able to execute `transferOwnership` and `renounceOwnership`. The `owner` function is view-only and safe to call externally. Ensure that `transferOwnership` correctly handles the case where `_newOwner` is set to `address(0)` for renouncement.
