<DocSubtitle>
Manages ownership and control of the diamond.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Enables secure transfer of diamond ownership.
- Allows for complete relinquishment of diamond control via `renounceOwnership`.
- Provides a clear interface for querying the current owner.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerFacet provides essential functions for managing the ownership of the Compose diamond. It allows for querying the current owner, transferring ownership to a new address, and renouncing ownership entirely. This facet is crucial for controlling administrative actions and ensuring secure operation.

      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the owner."
    }

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerFacet} from "@compose/contracts/src/facets/Owner/IOwnerFacet.sol";

contract OwnerManager {
    IOwnerFacet ownerFacet;

    constructor(address _ownerFacetAddress) {
        ownerFacet = IOwnerFacet(_ownerFacetAddress);
    }

    function getCurrentOwner() external view returns (address) {
        return ownerFacet.owner();
    }

    function transferDiamondOwnership(address _newOwner) external {
        ownerFacet.transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function renounceDiamondOwnership() external {
        ownerFacet.renounceOwnership();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize ownership during diamond deployment to a trusted address.
- Only transfer ownership to addresses that can be secured and managed.
- Use `renounceOwnership` with extreme caution, as it permanently relinquishes control.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
The `transferOwnership` function is critical. Ensure that any address receiving ownership has robust security measures in place. Unauthorized transfer of ownership can lead to the loss of control over the diamond. `renounceOwnership` is irreversible and should only be called if full relinquishment of control is intended and understood.
