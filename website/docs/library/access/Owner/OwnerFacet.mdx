<DocSubtitle>
Manages contract ownership and transfers.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Standard ERC-173 ownership pattern implementation.
- Provides explicit functions for owner retrieval, transfer, and renunciation.
- Supports ownership transfer to `address(0)` for renunciation.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerFacet provides standard ownership management functions for a Compose diamond. It allows for the retrieval of the current owner, the transfer of ownership to a new address, and the renunciation of ownership. This facet is crucial for controlling administrative functions within the diamond.

## Functions

### getStorage

Returns a pointer to the owner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getStorage() internal pure returns (OwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "s",
      type: "OwnerStorage",
      description: "The OwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

### owner

Get the address of the owner

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() external view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "-",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the owner."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### transferOwnership

Set the address of the new owner of the contract Set _newOwner to address(0) to renounce any ownership.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable

    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

</AccordionGroup>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerFacet} from "@compose/facets/owner/IOwnerFacet.sol";

contract OwnerConsumer {
    IOwnerFacet public ownerFacet;

    constructor(address _ownerFacetAddress) {
        ownerFacet = IOwnerFacet(_ownerFacetAddress);
    }

    function getCurrentOwner() external view returns (address) {
        return ownerFacet.owner();
    }

    function transferDiamondOwnership(address _newOwner) external {
        ownerFacet.transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function renounceDiamondOwnership() external {
        ownerFacet.renounceOwnership();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize ownership during diamond deployment to a trusted address.
- Only transfer ownership to addresses that are prepared to manage the diamond's administrative functions.
- Use `renounceOwnership` with extreme caution, as it permanently removes the owner.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Ownership is a critical administrative role. Ensure that ownership transfers are authorized and that the new owner is a secure and trusted address. The `transferOwnership` function can be used to renounce ownership by setting the `_newOwner` to `address(0)`. Unauthorized access to ownership transfer functions could lead to a loss of control over the diamond.
