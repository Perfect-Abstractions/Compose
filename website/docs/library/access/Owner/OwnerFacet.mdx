Manages contract ownership and transfer.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Defines and manages the owner of the diamond.
- Supports transferring ownership to a new address.
- Allows for renouncing ownership, making the diamond effectively immutable from an owner perspective.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerFacet provides essential ownership management capabilities for a Compose diamond. It allows an owner to transfer ownership to a new address or renounce ownership entirely, ensuring control and security over the diamond's administrative functions.

## Storage

### OwnerStorage

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={15} title="Definition">
{`struct OwnerStorage {
    address owner;
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

### State Variables

## Functions

### owner

Get the address of the owner

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() external view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerFacet} from "../facets/owner/IOwnerFacet.sol";

contract OwnerFacetDeployer {
    // Assuming the diamond proxy address is known
    address immutable DIAMOND_PROXY_ADDRESS;

    constructor(address _diamondProxyAddress) {
        DIAMOND_PROXY_ADDRESS = _diamondProxyAddress;
    }

    function getOwner() public view returns (address) {
        bytes4 selector = IOwnerFacet.owner.selector;
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = DIAMOND_PROXY_ADDRESS.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(selector));
        require(success, "Failed to get owner");
        return abi.decode(data, (address));
    }

    function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        bytes4 selector = IOwnerFacet.transferOwnership.selector;
        (bool success, ) = DIAMOND_PROXY_ADDRESS.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(selector, _newOwner));
        require(success, "Failed to transfer ownership");
    }

    function renounceOwnership() public {
        bytes4 selector = IOwnerFacet.renounceOwnership.selector;
        (bool success, ) = DIAMOND_PROXY_ADDRESS.call(abi.encodeWithSelector(selector));
        require(success, "Failed to renounce ownership");
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize ownership during diamond deployment, typically to the deployer address.
- Use `transferOwnership` to delegate administrative control to another address.
- Consider using `renounceOwnership` only when administrative control is no longer required and the diamond should be immutable.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Access to `transferOwnership` and `renounceOwnership` is restricted to the current owner. Ensure the owner's private key is secured to prevent unauthorized changes. Setting the new owner to `address(0)` is the mechanism for renouncing ownership; this action is irreversible. The `owner` function is public and can be called by any address.
