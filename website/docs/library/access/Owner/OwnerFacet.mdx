Manage contract ownership and transferability
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Exposes external functions for ownership management.
- Utilizes diamond storage for owner state.
- Compatible with ERC-2535 diamond standard.
- Provides functions for viewing, transferring, and renouncing ownership.
</Callout>

## Overview

This facet provides core ownership management functionality for a diamond. It exposes external functions to view the current owner and transfer ownership, leveraging diamond storage for state persistence. Developers integrate this facet to establish clear ownership and control over diamond operations.

---

## Storage

### OwnerStorage

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={15} title="Definition">
{`struct OwnerStorage {
    address owner;
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

### State Variables

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "STORAGE_POSITION",
      type: "bytes32",
      description: "Diamond storage slot position for this module (Value: `keccak256(\"compose.owner\")`)"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

## Functions

### owner

Get the address of the owner

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() external view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "-",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the owner."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### transferOwnership

Set the address of the new owner of the contract Set _newOwner to address(0) to renounce any ownership.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### renounceOwnership

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function renounceOwnership() external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Events

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OwnershipTransferred" defaultOpen={false}>

    <div style={{marginBottom: "1rem"}}>
      <strong>Signature:</strong>
      <ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={5}>
{`event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);`}
      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OwnerUnauthorizedAccount" defaultOpen={false}>

    <div>
      <strong>Signature:</strong>
      <ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={5}>
error OwnerUnauthorizedAccount();
      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity >=0.8.30;

import { IDiamond } from "@compose/diamond/IDiamond.sol";
import { OwnerFacet } from "@compose/access/Owner/OwnerFacet";

contract Deployer {
    address immutable DIAMOND_ADDRESS;

    constructor(address diamondAddress) {
        DIAMOND_ADDRESS = diamondAddress;
    }

    function setOwner(address newOwner) external {
        IDiamond diamond = IDiamond(DIAMOND_ADDRESS);
        // Call transferOwnership through the diamond proxy
        // Assumes OwnerFacet is already added and selectors are registered
        diamond.transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }

    function getOwner() external view returns (address) {
        IDiamond diamond = IDiamond(DIAMOND_ADDRESS);
        // Call owner through the diamond proxy
        return diamond.owner();
    }

    function renounceContractOwnership() external {
        IDiamond diamond = IDiamond(DIAMOND_ADDRESS);
        // Call renounceOwnership through the diamond proxy
        diamond.renounceOwnership();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize the owner address during the diamond's deployment phase.
- Ensure only authorized accounts can call `transferOwnership` and `renounceOwnership`.
- Verify compatibility with other access control facets before upgrading.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
The `transferOwnership` function allows setting the owner to `address(0)`, effectively renouncing ownership. Ensure that ownership is transferred to a valid and secure address or renounced intentionally. All state-changing functions are expected to be protected by appropriate access control mechanisms, typically enforced by other facets or the diamond itself. Follow standard Solidity security practices for input validation.
