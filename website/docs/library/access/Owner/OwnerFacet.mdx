<DocSubtitle>
Manages diamond ownership and transfers.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Provides owner address retrieval.
- Supports ownership transfer to a new address.
- Allows for the renunciation of ownership.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerFacet provides essential functions for managing the ownership of a Compose diamond. It allows querying the current owner, transferring ownership to a new address, and renouncing ownership entirely. This facet is crucial for controlling administrative actions within the diamond.

## Storage

### OwnerStorage

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={15} title="Definition">
{`struct OwnerStorage {
    address owner;
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

### State Variables

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "STORAGE_POSITION",
      type: "constant",
      description: "Diamond storage slot position for this module"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

## Functions

### owner

Get the address of the owner

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() external view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "-",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the owner."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### transferOwnership

Set the address of the new owner of the contract Set _newOwner to address(0) to renounce any ownership.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

### renounceOwnership

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function renounceOwnership() external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Events

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OwnershipTransferred" defaultOpen={false}>

    <div style={{marginBottom: "1rem"}}>
      <strong>Signature:</strong>
      <ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={5}>
{`event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);`}
      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OwnerUnauthorizedAccount" defaultOpen={false}>

    <div>
      <strong>Signature:</strong>
      <ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={5}>
error OwnerUnauthorizedAccount();
      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerFacet} from "../interfaces/IOwnerFacet.sol";

contract Deployer {
    // Assume diamondAbi is the ABI of your diamond
    // Assume diamondAddress is the address of your deployed diamond
    IOwnerFacet ownerFacet = IOwnerFacet(diamondAddress);

    function getCurrentOwner() external view returns (address) {
        return ownerFacet.owner();
    }

    function transferDiamondOwnership(address _newOwner) external {
        // Ensure you have the necessary permissions to call this function
        ownerFacet.transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function renounceDiamondOwnership() external {
        // Ensure you have the necessary permissions to call this function
        ownerFacet.renounceOwnership();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Use `transferOwnership` to safely delegate control by setting a new owner.
- Call `renounceOwnership` with extreme caution, as it makes the diamond effectively un-administerable.
- Ensure that only authorized entities can call `transferOwnership` and `renounceOwnership`.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Ownership transfer functions (`transferOwnership`, `renounceOwnership`) are highly sensitive. Ensure that calls to these functions are restricted to the current owner or a designated administrative role to prevent unauthorized control of the diamond. The `transferOwnership` function allows setting the new owner to `address(0)` to effectively renounce ownership, which should be handled with care.
