<DocSubtitle>
Manages diamond ownership and transfers.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Provides a standard interface for diamond ownership management.
- Supports both explicit transfer and unconditional renouncement of ownership.
- Includes a function to access raw storage for advanced inspection.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerFacet provides essential functions for managing the ownership of a Compose diamond. It allows for querying the current owner, transferring ownership to a new address, and renouncing ownership entirely. This facet is crucial for controlling administrative actions within the diamond.

## Storage

### OwnerStorage

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={15} title="Definition">
{`struct OwnerStorage {
    address owner;
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

### State Variables

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "STORAGE_POSITION",
      type: "bytes32",
      description: "Diamond storage slot position for this module (Value: `keccak256(\"compose.owner\")`)"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

## Functions

### owner

Get the address of the owner

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() external view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "-",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the owner."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### transferOwnership

Set the address of the new owner of the contract Set _newOwner to address(0) to renounce any ownership.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerFacet} from "../interfaces/IOwnerFacet.sol";

contract OwnerFacetDeployer {
    IOwnerFacet ownerFacet;

    function deployOwnerFacet(address _diamondProxy) public {
        // Assume OwnerFacet is already deployed and its implementation address is known
        // In a real scenario, you would deploy the OwnerFacet implementation contract first.
        address ownerFacetImpl = address(0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890); // Replace with actual implementation address

        // Add the facet to the diamond proxy (using a hypothetical diamond ABI encoder)
        // bytes4[] memory selectors = new bytes4[](4);
        // selectors[0] = IOwnerFacet.owner.selector;
        // selectors[1] = IOwnerFacet.transferOwnership.selector;
        // selectors[2] = IOwnerFacet.renounceOwnership.selector;
        // selectors[3] = IOwnerFacet.getStorage.selector;
        // _diamondCut(selectors, ownerFacetImpl, 1); // Example call to a diamond cut function

        ownerFacet = IOwnerFacet(_diamondProxy);
    }

    function getDiamondOwner() public view returns (address) {
        return ownerFacet.owner();
    }

    function transferDiamondOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        ownerFacet.transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function renounceDiamondOwnership() public {
        ownerFacet.renounceOwnership();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize ownership to a trusted address during diamond deployment.
- Use `transferOwnership` for planned transitions and `renounceOwnership` only when administrative control is no longer required.
- Ensure that the address receiving ownership has appropriate security measures in place.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Ownership transfers should be handled with extreme care. Ensure that the `_newOwner` address is valid and trusted before initiating a transfer. Renouncing ownership permanently removes administrative control, so this action should only be performed if the diamond is intended to be fully decentralized or abandoned. The `owner` function returns the current owner, which is critical for access control checks in other facets.
