<DocSubtitle>
Manages contract ownership with a two-step transfer process.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Two-step ownership transfer (`transferOwnership` then `acceptOwnership`) for enhanced security.
- Explicit getter functions (`owner`, `pendingOwner`) to retrieve ownership status.
- Ability to renounce ownership, making the contract effectively immutable regarding owner-driven changes.
</Callout>

## Overview

This facet provides a robust ownership management system for Compose diamonds, enforcing a two-step `transferOwnership` and `acceptOwnership` mechanism. This pattern enhances security by requiring explicit confirmation from the new owner before ownership is fully transferred, mitigating risks associated with accidental or malicious ownership changes.

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerTwoStepsFacet} from "@compose/facets/owner/OwnerTwoStepsFacet.sol";

contract OwnerConsumer {
    IOwnerTwoStepsFacet public ownerFacet;

    constructor(address _ownerFacetAddress) {
        ownerFacet = IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(_ownerFacetAddress);
    }

    function proposeNewOwner(address _newOwner) external {
        // Assuming the caller is the current owner
        ownerFacet.transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function acceptNewOwner() external {
        // Assuming the caller is the pending owner
        ownerFacet.acceptOwnership();
    }

    function getCurrentOwner() external view returns (address) {
        return ownerFacet.owner();
    }

    function getPendingOwnerAddress() external view returns (address) {
        return ownerFacet.pendingOwner();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize the `OwnerTwoStepsFacet` during diamond deployment and assign it to the current owner.
- Ensure that `transferOwnership` is only callable by the current owner and `acceptOwnership` is only callable by the pending owner.
- Store the facet's storage slots (`OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION`, `PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION`) securely and access them via the provided getter functions.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
The `transferOwnership` function should only be callable by the current owner to prevent unauthorized ownership changes. The `acceptOwnership` function must only be callable by the pending owner. The `renounceOwnership` function permanently relinquishes ownership and should be used with extreme caution. Direct manipulation of storage slots via `getOwnerStorage` and `getPendingOwnerStorage` should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and with a full understanding of the implications.
