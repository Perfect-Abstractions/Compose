Manages ownership transfer with a two-step verification process.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Two-step ownership transfer process (initiate and accept).
- Provides `owner()`, `pendingOwner()`, `transferOwnership()`, `acceptOwnership()`, and `renounceOwnership()` functions.
- Uses specific storage slots for owner and pending owner states, accessible via `getOwnerStorage` and `getPendingOwnerStorage`.
</Callout>

## Overview

This facet provides a robust ownership management system for Compose diamonds. It enforces a two-step ownership transfer process, requiring both the current owner to initiate the transfer and the new owner to accept it, enhancing security against accidental or unauthorized ownership changes.

## Storage

### OwnerStorage

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerTwoStepsFacet} from "@compose/facets/owner/OwnerTwoStepsFacet.sol";
import {DiamondProxy} from "@compose/diamond/DiamondProxy.sol";

contract MyDiamond is DiamondProxy {
    // ... deployment logic ...

    function _setup() internal override {
        // ... other facet setups ...
        // Add OwnerTwoStepsFacet
        address ownerTwoStepsFacetAddress = address(new OwnerTwoStepsFacet()); // Replace with actual deployment
        _diamondCut(new IOperation[][](0), ownerTwoStepsFacetAddress, "OwnerTwoStepsFacet");

        // Initialize ownership
        IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(ownerTwoStepsFacetAddress).transferOwnership(newOwnerAddress);
    }

    function transferOwnershipToNewOwner(address newOwnerAddress) external {
        address ownerTwoStepsFacetAddress = address(this).getFacetAddress("OwnerTwoStepsFacet");
        IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(ownerTwoStepsFacetAddress).transferOwnership(newOwnerAddress);
    }

    function acceptNewOwnership() external {
        address ownerTwoStepsFacetAddress = address(this).getFacetAddress("OwnerTwoStepsFacet");
        IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(ownerTwoStepsFacetAddress).acceptOwnership();
    }

    function renounceDiamondOwnership() external {
        address ownerTwoStepsFacetAddress = address(this).getFacetAddress("OwnerTwoStepsFacet");
        IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(ownerTwoStepsFacetAddress).renounceOwnership();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize ownership by calling `transferOwnership` during diamond deployment or upgrade.
- The new owner must call `acceptOwnership` to finalize the transfer.
- Use `owner()` and `pendingOwner()` to track the current and pending ownership states.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
The `transferOwnership` function can only be called by the current owner. The `acceptOwnership` function can only be called by the pending owner. Direct calls to `getOwnerStorage` or `getPendingOwnerStorage` should be avoided in favor of the public getter functions to maintain encapsulation and prevent accidental state manipulation.
