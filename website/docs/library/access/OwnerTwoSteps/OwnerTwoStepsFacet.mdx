<DocSubtitle>
Manage diamond ownership with a two-step transfer process.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Secure two-step ownership transfer process (initiate and accept).
- Prevents accidental loss of ownership.
- Standardized access control pattern for diamond management.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerTwoSteps facet provides a secure, two-step mechanism for transferring ownership of the diamond. This pattern prevents accidental ownership loss by requiring both the current owner to initiate a transfer and the new owner to explicitly accept it, enhancing the security of critical diamond operations.

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {DiamondCutFacet} from "@compose/diamond/DiamondCutFacet.sol";
import {DiamondLoupeFacet} from "@compose/diamond/DiamondLoupeFacet.sol";
import {Diamond} from "@compose/diamond/Diamond.sol";
import {OwnerTwoStepsFacet} from "@compose/access/OwnerTwoSteps/OwnerTwoStepsFacet.sol";

contract MyDiamond is Diamond {
    constructor(address[] memory _initFacets, bytes[] memory _calldatas) Diamond(_initFacets, _calldatas) {}

    // Example of calling transferOwnership through the diamond proxy
    function initiateOwnershipTransfer(address _newOwner) external {
        address ownerTwoStepsFacetAddress = getFacetAddress("OwnerTwoStepsFacet");
        OwnerTwoStepsFacet(ownerTwoStepsFacetAddress).transferOwnership(_newOwner);

        OwnerTwoStepsFacet(ownerTwoStepsFacetAddress).acceptOwnership();
    }

    // Helper to get facet address (implementation omitted for brevity)
    function getFacetAddress(string memory _facetName) internal view returns (address) {
        // In a real diamond, you would query the DiamondLoupeFacet or similar
        // For this example, assume we know the address or can retrieve it
        return address(1); // Placeholder address
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize the `OwnerTwoStepsFacet` during diamond deployment to set the initial owner.
- Always use the `transferOwnership` function to initiate a change, followed by `acceptOwnership` from the new owner.
- Ensure the diamond proxy is correctly configured to route calls to the `OwnerTwoStepsFacet` for ownership management functions.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Access to `transferOwnership` and `acceptOwnership` is restricted to the current owner and the pending owner, respectively. The `owner` and `pendingOwner` views are public. Ensure that only authorized entities can call these functions through the diamond proxy. No reentrancy concerns as state changes are atomic and external calls are limited.
