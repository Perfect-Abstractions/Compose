<DocSubtitle>
Manage contract ownership with a two-step transfer process.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Two-step ownership transfer: `transferOwnership` and `acceptOwnership`.
- Clear separation of owner and pending owner states.
- Provides functions to retrieve current and pending owner addresses.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerTwoStepsFacet provides a robust mechanism for managing the ownership of a Compose diamond. It enforces a two-step ownership transfer process to prevent accidental loss of control, requiring both the current owner to initiate a transfer and the new owner to accept it. This facet is crucial for secure administrative control over diamond functionalities.

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerTwoStepsFacet} from "@compose/contracts/diamond/facets/IOwnerTwoStepsFacet.sol";

contract Deployer {
    address immutable DIAMOND_PROXY;

    constructor(address diamondProxy) {
        DIAMOND_PROXY = diamondProxy;
    }

    function transferDiamondOwnership(address _newOwner) public {
        IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(DIAMOND_PROXY).transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function acceptDiamondOwnership() public {
        IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(DIAMOND_PROXY).acceptOwnership();
    }

    function getCurrentOwner() public view returns (address) {
        return IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(DIAMOND_PROXY).owner();
    }

    function getPendingOwner() public view returns (address) {
        return IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(DIAMOND_PROXY).pendingOwner();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize ownership correctly during diamond deployment.
- Ensure the `acceptOwnership` function is called by the intended new owner.
- Use `owner()` and `pendingOwner()` to track ownership status accurately.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Access to `transferOwnership`, `acceptOwnership`, and `renounceOwnership` is restricted to the current owner. The `acceptOwnership` function can only be called by the address designated as the pending owner. There is a risk of losing ownership if the `transferOwnership` function is called with an address that cannot later call `acceptOwnership`.
