<DocSubtitle>
Two-step contract ownership transfer logic.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Secure two-step ownership transfer process.
- Explicit `acceptOwnership` confirmation required from the new owner.
- Provides `owner()`, `pendingOwner()`, and `renounceOwnership()` for state inspection and management.
- Integrates with diamond storage using defined storage positions.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Module Usage">
This module provides internal functions for use in your custom facets. Import it to access shared logic and storage.
</Callout>

## Overview

This module provides a robust, two-step ownership transfer mechanism, enhancing security by requiring explicit confirmation from the new owner. It integrates seamlessly with the Compose diamond storage pattern, ensuring ownership state is managed predictably and upgrade-safely.

## Functions

### acceptOwnership

Finalizes ownership transfer; must be called by the pending owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function acceptOwnership() ;`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### getOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the Owner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getOwnerStorage() pure returns (OwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "s",
      type: "OwnerStorage",
      description: "The OwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### getPendingOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the PendingOwner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getPendingOwnerStorage() pure returns (PendingOwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[

  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### owner

Returns the current owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### pendingOwner

Returns the pending owner (if any).

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function pendingOwner() view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### renounceOwnership

Renounce ownership of the contract Sets the owner to address(0), disabling all functions restricted to the owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function renounceOwnership() ;`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### requireOwner

Reverts if the caller is not the owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function requireOwner() view;`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### transferOwnership

Initiates a two-step ownership transfer.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) ;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {OwnerTwoStepsMod} from "@compose/access/OwnerTwoSteps/OwnerTwoStepsMod";
import {IOwnerTwoStepsFacet} from "@compose/access/OwnerTwoSteps/IOwnerTwoStepsFacet";

contract MyFacet {
    // Assume OwnerTwoStepsMod is initialized and its storage slot is known
    address public constant OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION = OwnerTwoStepsMod.OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION;
    address public constant PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION = OwnerTwoStepsMod.PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION;

    // Example of calling transferOwnership from a facet
    function initiateOwnershipTransfer(address _newOwner) external {
        // Assuming IOwnerTwoStepsFacet is implemented by the diamond proxy
        IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(msg.sender).transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    // Example of calling acceptOwnership
    function finalizeOwnershipTransfer() external {
        IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(msg.sender).acceptOwnership();
    }

    // Example of checking ownership
    function checkOwnership() external view {
        require(OwnerTwoStepsMod.owner() == msg.sender, "Not the owner");
        // ... owner-specific logic
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Always use the `transferOwnership` function to initiate a transfer and `acceptOwnership` to finalize it. Never call `acceptOwnership` directly without a prior `transferOwnership` call.
- Implement `requireOwner()` checks judiciously, ensuring critical administrative functions are protected.
- Be aware that `renounceOwnership()` permanently relinquishes ownership, setting the owner to `address(0)`.
</Callout>

## Integration Notes

<Callout type="success" title="Shared Storage">
This module utilizes the diamond storage pattern, storing ownership and pending ownership states at `OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION` and `PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION` respectively. Facets interacting with ownership logic should reference these positions and the `OwnerStorage` and `PendingOwnerStorage` structs. The `owner()` and `pendingOwner()` functions provide view access to these states. Functions like `requireOwner()` will revert if the caller is not the current owner, enforcing access control based on the module's state.
