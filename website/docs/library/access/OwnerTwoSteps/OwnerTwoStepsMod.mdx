Manages contract ownership with a two-step transfer process.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Implements a secure two-step ownership transfer via `transferOwnership` and `acceptOwnership`.
- Provides `owner()` and `pendingOwner()` view functions to query current and pending ownership.
- Includes `renounceOwnership()` to permanently disable owner-restricted functions.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Module Usage">
This module provides internal functions for use in your custom facets. Import it to access shared logic and storage.
</Callout>

## Overview

This module implements a secure two-step ownership transfer mechanism, ensuring that ownership changes are deliberate and auditable. By requiring explicit acceptance from the new owner, it mitigates risks associated with accidental or malicious ownership transfers, enhancing the overall safety and composability of your diamond.

## Functions

### acceptOwnership

Finalizes ownership transfer; must be called by the pending owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function acceptOwnership() ;`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### getOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the Owner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getOwnerStorage() pure returns (OwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "s",
      type: "OwnerStorage",
      description: "The OwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### getPendingOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the PendingOwner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getPendingOwnerStorage() pure returns (PendingOwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "s",
      type: "PendingOwnerStorage",
      description: "The PendingOwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### owner

Returns the current owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### pendingOwner

Returns the pending owner (if any).

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function pendingOwner() view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### renounceOwnership

Renounce ownership of the contract Sets the owner to address(0), disabling all functions restricted to the owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function renounceOwnership() ;`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### requireOwner

Reverts if the caller is not the owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function requireOwner() view;`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### transferOwnership

Initiates a two-step ownership transfer.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) ;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {OwnerTwoStepsMod} from "../OwnerTwoStepsMod.sol";

contract MyFacet is OwnerTwoStepsMod {
    // Assume OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION and PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION are defined and set
    // in the diamond deployment.

    function someOwnerRestrictedFunction() external {
        requireOwner(); // Ensure only the owner can call this function
        // ... owner-only logic ...
    }

    function initiateOwnershipTransfer(address _newOwner) external {
        transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function acceptNewOwnership() external {
        acceptOwnership();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Use `requireOwner()` judiciously to protect critical functions, ensuring only the designated owner can execute sensitive operations.
- Handle `OwnerUnauthorizedAccount` and `OwnerAlreadyRenounced` errors appropriately in your calling contracts or frontend applications.
- Be aware that `renounceOwnership()` permanently relinquishes owner privileges; ensure this action is intended and irreversible.
</Callout>

## Integration Notes

<Callout type="success" title="Shared Storage">
The `OwnerTwoStepsMod` relies on specific storage slots for its `Owner` and `PendingOwner` state variables. These slots are typically defined as constants (e.g., `OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION`, `PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION`) within the diamond's facet deployment. Facets interacting with this module can access the owner information via the `owner()` and `pendingOwner()` view functions. The `requireOwner()` internal function enforces access control by checking against the current owner's address.
