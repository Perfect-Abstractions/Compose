Manages contract ownership with a two-step transfer process.
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Implements a secure two-step ownership transfer process.
- Provides functions to view current and pending owners.
- Includes a `requireOwner` guard for access control.
- Supports renouncing ownership to address(0).
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Module Usage">
This module provides internal functions for use in your custom facets. Import it to access shared logic and storage.
</Callout>

## Overview

This module implements a secure two-step ownership transfer mechanism, preventing accidental ownership loss. It ensures that ownership changes are deliberate and confirmed by both the current and pending owners, enhancing the safety and auditability of diamond upgrades and administrative actions.

## Functions

### acceptOwnership

Finalizes ownership transfer; must be called by the pending owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function acceptOwnership() ;`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### getOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the Owner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getOwnerStorage() pure returns (OwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {

      type: "OwnerStorage",
      description: "The OwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### getPendingOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the PendingOwner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getPendingOwnerStorage() pure returns (PendingOwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[

      name: "s",
      type: "PendingOwnerStorage",
      description: "The PendingOwnerStorage struct in storage."

  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### owner

Returns the current owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### pendingOwner

Returns the pending owner (if any).

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function pendingOwner() view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### renounceOwnership

Renounce ownership of the contract Sets the owner to address(0), disabling all functions restricted to the owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function renounceOwnership() ;`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### requireOwner

Reverts if the caller is not the owner.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function requireOwner() view;`}
</ExpandableCode>

---
### transferOwnership

Initiates a two-step ownership transfer.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) ;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {OwnerTwoStepsMod} from "./OwnerTwoStepsMod.sol";

contract MyFacet is OwnerTwoStepsMod {
    address public constant OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION = OwnerTwoStepsMod.OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION;
    address public constant PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION = OwnerTwoStepsMod.PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION;

    function initializeOwner(address _initialOwner) external {
        // Initialize owner using the module's logic
        // This would typically be called once during diamond deployment
        // For demonstration, we simulate setting it directly
        // In a real scenario, use OwnerTwoStepsMod.transferOwnership to set initial owner
    }

    function transferContractOwnership(address _newOwner) external {
        transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function acceptContractOwnership() external {
        acceptOwnership();
    }

    function renounceContractOwnership() external {
        renounceOwnership();
    }

    function getCurrentOwner() external view returns (address) {
        return owner();
    }

    function getPendingContractOwner() external view returns (address) {
        return pendingOwner();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Always use `transferOwnership` to initiate a transfer, followed by `acceptOwnership` by the new owner.
- Utilize `requireOwner` to protect sensitive administrative functions.
- Be aware that `renounceOwnership` permanently disables owner-only functions.
</Callout>

## Integration Notes

<Callout type="success" title="Shared Storage">
This module utilizes distinct storage slots for `owner` and `pendingOwner` state variables, defined by `OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION` and `PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION`. Facets interacting with ownership should be aware of these positions if they need to directly access or verify the owner state. The functions provided (`owner`, `pendingOwner`, `transferOwnership`, `acceptOwnership`, `renounceOwnership`, `requireOwner`) abstract away direct storage manipulation, promoting a cleaner interface.
