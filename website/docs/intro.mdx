<DocSubtitle>
**Compose** is a smart contract library that helps developers build modular, upgradeable systems using the [ERC-2535 Diamond](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) standard. It's designed from the ground up for **code clarity**, **reusability**, and **on-chain composability**.
</DocSubtitle>

## The Vision

Imagine a verified, standard library of **on-chain smart contract components** —
each one small, self-contained, and reusable like LEGO blocks.

Deployed once, trusted by all, and combined in endless ways to create new systems.

That's **Compose** — where your unique value and functionality connects seamlessly with simple, transparent, onchain building blocks.

## Why Choose Compose?
