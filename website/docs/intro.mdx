**Compose** is a general-purpose smart contract library that helps you build smart contract systems.

Traditional smart contract libraries give you source code that you must modify, extend, and deploy yourself to one or more blockchains.

**Compose takes a different approach.**

Compose provides a set of **reusable on-chain contracts** that already exist on blockchains—you don't need to deploy or manage them yourself. The heavy lifting has been done.

For your next project, instead of deploying new contracts, simply **use the existing on-chain contracts** provided by Compose.

## Reusable Smart Contracts

You might be wondering: **How can I create a new project without deploying new smart contracts?**

How does Compose make it possible to build new systems from existing onchain contracts?

The answer lies in Compose’s smart contract architecture, which is based on [diamond contracts](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535).

A diamond contract is a simple, tiny contract that **uses the code of other onchain contracts** called **facets**. Each diamond uses the code of other contracts (facets) to create and maintain its storage data and state.

Below is a diagram showing a diamond connected to multiple facets that provide its functionality.

<DiamondFacetsSVG style={{ width: '800', height: 'auto' }} />

When you use Compose, you *do* deploy new contracts—but only the small diamond contract that ties together existing onchain facets.

Let's look at a simple example.

Suppose you want to create a new ERC-20 token that supports gasless approvals (permit) and cross-chain bridging.

With Compose, you can:

1. **Select the facets you need** – for example, `ERC20Facet`, `ERC20PermitFacet`, and `ERC20BridgableFacet`.
2. **Provide initialization data** – such as the token name, symbol, and total supply.
3. **Deploy your diamond** – which initializes your ERC-20 token and connects it to the chosen facets.

:::tip[Key Insight]
Many diamond contracts can be deployed that **reuse the same onchain facets**.
:::

## Composable Contracts

The word "composable" means capable of being combined with other parts or elements to form a whole. As much as possible Compose facets are designed to be composable. Facets are designed to work with other facets in the same diamond. 

:::tip[Key Insight]
Onchain facets are the building blocks of Compose.
:::

**Examples of composition:**
1. Facets `ERC20Facet`, `ERC20PermitFacet` and `ERC20BridgableFacet` work together in the same diamond.
2. Facets `ERC721Facet`, `ERC721MetadataFacet`, `ERC721RoyaltyFacet` work together in the same diamond.

In the past, smart contract libraries extended existing functionality by using inheritance at the source code level. For example `contract ERC20Permit is ERC20` etc. Such inheritance is unnecessary with Compose since we are composing facets on the blockchain. 

## Custom Functionality: Compose Your Facets with Compose

We recognize that many projects want to create their own unique functionality. We want to help you integrate custom facets with Compose facets.

Compose provides Solidity libraries to access and use the same storage data and functionality that Compose facets use.

For example, let's say that you want to make an onchain game and are going to add the ERC721Facet to your diamond. You want to add some of your own functionality to the diamond so you develop your own `GameFacet`. You can use the `LibERC721` library from Compose to access ERC721 data and functionality. Here is a simple example:

```Solidity
// Your custom facet integrates with Compose using libraries
import {LibERC721} from "compose/LibERC721.sol";

contract GameNFTFacet {
    function mintWithGameLogic(address player, uint256 tokenId) external {
        // Your custom game logic
        require(playerHasEnoughPoints(player), "Not enough points");
        
        // Use LibERC721 to mint - this modifies the SAME storage
        // that ERC721Facet uses for balanceOf(), ownerOf(), etc.
        LibERC721.mint(player, tokenId);
        
        // Now the player owns this NFT and can use standard
        // ERC721Facet.transferFrom() to transfer it!
        updatePlayerStats(player);
    }
}
```
:::tip[Key Insight]
Both your `GameFacet` and the standard `ERC721Facet` work with the **same storage** in your diamond. This is the power of Compose's shared storage architecture.

:::warning[Early State Development]
Compose is currently in development and only available to contributors. It is **NOT production ready**. Use at your own risk in development environments only.

## What is Compose?

**Compose** is a smart contract library that helps developers create smart contract systems using the [ERC-2535 Diamond](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) standard. It's designed from the ground up to prioritize code readability and onchain composability.

### The Vision

Imagine a verified, standard library of onchain smart contract components you combine like LEGO blocks. Deployed once and reused across projects. That's Compose.

Isolated, small, simply written onchain components that are composed with your unique functionality. That's your smart contract system.
