Past smart contract libraries gave you source code and expected you to extend or modify it and then deploy it to one or more blockchains. 

Compose is different. We **don't** expect you to do that. We take a different approach.

Compose gives you a set of reusable smart contracts that already exist on blockchains. You don't have to deploy Compose source code. It's already been done. The smart contracts are already deployed for your use.

For your new project, instead of deploying new contracts, use existing onchain smart contracts provided by Compose.

  We haven't actually deployed smart contracts yet because we are in early development. We are building. If this is exciting to you, come join us.

## Reusable Smart Contracts

You might wonder how to create a new project without deploying new smart contracts. How does Compose enable people to create new smart contract systems using existing onchain contracts?

This is where Compose's smart contract architecture comes in. Compose uses [diamond contracts](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) 
to organize smart contracts and make them reusable. 

A diamond contract is a simple, small contract that uses the code of other onchain contracts.

A diamond contract creates and maintains its own storage data using code from other contracts. These "other contracts" are called facets. Here is a diagram of a diamond that shows it gets its code from facets.

<DiamondFacetsSVG style={{ width: '800', height: 'auto' }} />

Using Compose you do actually deploy new contracts. Specifically you deploy a small diamond contract that uses existing onchain facets.

Let's look at a simple example of how this works. Let's say that you want to create a new ERC20 token that uses the gasless "permit" function and can be bridged to other blockchains. **Use Compose to:**

1. Find and choose onchain facets you need. In this case `ERC20Facet`, `ERC20PermitFacet` and `ERC20BridgableFacet`.
2. Setup initialization information such as the name of your ERC20 token, its total supply, etc.
3. Deploy a diamond which initializes your ERC20 token and uses the onchain facets in step 1.

:::tip[Key Insight]
Many diamond contracts are deployed that reuse the same onchain facets.
:::

## Composable Contracts

The word "composable" means capable of being combined with other parts or elements to form a whole. As much as possible Compose facets are designed to be composable. Facets are designed to work with other facets in the same diamond. 

:::tip[Key Insight]
Onchain facets are the building blocks of Compose.
:::

**Examples of composition:**
1. Facets `ERC20Facet`, `ERC20PermitFacet` and `ERC20BridgableFacet` work together in the same diamond.
2. Facets `ERC721Facet`, `ERC721MetadataFacet`, `ERC721RoyaltyFacet` work together in the same diamond.

In the past, smart contract libraries extended existing functionality by using inheritance at the source code level. For example `contract ERC20Permit is ERC20` etc. Such inheritance is unnecessary with Compose since we are composing facets on the blockchain. 

## Custom Functionality: Compose Your Facets with Compose

We recognize that many projects want to create their own unique functionality. We want to help you integrate custom facets with Compose facets.

Compose provides Solidity libraries to access and use the same storage data and functionality that Compose facets use.

For example, let's say that you want to make an onchain game and are going to add the ERC721Facet to your diamond. You want to add some of your own functionality to the diamond so you develop your own `GameFacet`. You can use the `LibERC721` library from Compose to access ERC721 data and functionality. Here is a simple example:

```Solidity
// Your custom facet integrates with Compose using libraries
import {LibERC721} from "compose/LibERC721.sol";

contract GameNFTFacet {
    function mintWithGameLogic(address player, uint256 tokenId) external {
        // Your custom game logic
        require(playerHasEnoughPoints(player), "Not enough points");
        
        // Use LibERC721 to mint - this modifies the SAME storage
        // that ERC721Facet uses for balanceOf(), ownerOf(), etc.
        LibERC721.mint(player, tokenId);
        
        // Now the player owns this NFT and can use standard
        // ERC721Facet.transferFrom() to transfer it!
        updatePlayerStats(player);
    }
}
```
:::tip[Key Insight]
Both your `GameFacet` and the standard `ERC721Facet` work with the **same storage** in your diamond. This is the power of Compose's shared storage architecture.

## What is Compose?

**Compose** is a smart contract library that helps developers create smart contract systems using the [ERC-2535 Diamond](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) standard. It's designed from the ground up to prioritize code readability and onchain composability.

### The Vision

Imagine a verified, standard library of onchain smart contract components you combine like LEGO blocks. Deployed once and reused across projects. That's Compose.

Isolated, small, simply written onchain components that are composed with your unique functionality. That's your smart contract system.
