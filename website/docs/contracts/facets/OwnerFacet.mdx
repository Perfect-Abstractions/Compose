Ownership management facet for Compose diamonds
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Manages the single administrative owner of the diamond.
- Supports transferring ownership to a new address, including the ability to renounce ownership by setting the new owner to `address(0)`.
- Provides direct access to the owner's storage slot via `getStorage` for advanced inspection.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerFacet provides essential ownership management capabilities for a Compose diamond. It allows for retrieving the current owner, transferring ownership to a new address, and renouncing ownership entirely. This facet ensures a clear chain of control and administrative access within the diamond.

## Storage

### OwnerStorage

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={15} title="Definition">
{`struct OwnerStorage {
    address owner;
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

### State Variables

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "STORAGE_POSITION",
      type: "constant",
      description: "Diamond storage slot position for this module"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

## Functions

### getStorage

Returns a pointer to the owner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getStorage() internal pure returns (OwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "s",
      type: "OwnerStorage",
      description: "The OwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

### owner

Get the address of the owner

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() external view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "-",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the owner."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### transferOwnership

Set the address of the new owner of the contract Set _newOwner to address(0) to renounce any ownership.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

### renounceOwnership

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function renounceOwnership() external;`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Events

    <div style={{marginBottom: "1rem"}}>
      <strong>Signature:</strong>
      <ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={5}>
{`event OwnershipTransferred(address indexed previousOwner, address indexed newOwner);`}
      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="OwnerUnauthorizedAccount" defaultOpen={false}>

      <ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={5}>
error OwnerUnauthorizedAccount();
      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerFacet} from "@compose/diamond/facets/Owner/IOwnerFacet.sol";

contract OwnerConsumer {
    IOwnerFacet internal ownerFacet;

    // Assume ownerFacet is initialized with the diamond's address
    constructor(address _diamondAddress) {
        ownerFacet = IOwnerFacet(_diamondAddress);
    }

    function getCurrentOwner() external view returns (address) {
        return ownerFacet.owner();
    }

    function transferControl(address _newOwner) external {
        // Access control for transferOwnership would typically be implemented
        // within the diamond's access control facet or by checking owner() here.
        ownerFacet.transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function abdicate() external {
        // Ensure this contract is the current owner before renouncing
        require(ownerFacet.owner() == address(this), "Not owner");
        ownerFacet.renounceOwnership();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize the OwnerFacet with the diamond's address to interact with its ownership functions.
- Implement robust access control checks in calling facets or within the diamond's logic layer before invoking `transferOwnership` or `renounceOwnership`.
- When transferring ownership, ensure the `_newOwner` address is validated to prevent accidental lockouts.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
The `transferOwnership` function is a critical administrative control. Ensure that calls to this function are protected by appropriate access control mechanisms (e.g., only callable by the current owner or a designated admin role). Renouncing ownership removes all administrative capabilities, making the contract effectively immutable from an administrative standpoint unless ownership is re-established through other means (which is not possible with this facet alone).
