Two-step ownership transfer facet for Compose diamonds
</DocSubtitle>

<Callout type="info" title="Key Features">
- Two-step ownership transfer process for enhanced security.
- Explicit functions for viewing current and pending ownership states.
- Supports `renounceOwnership` to relinquish ownership.
</Callout>

## Overview

The OwnerTwoStepsFacet manages contract ownership through a secure two-step transfer process. This facet provides functions to view the current and pending owner, initiate a transfer, and accept ownership, ensuring that ownership changes are deliberate and confirmed by both parties.

### State Variables

<PropertyTable

## Functions

### getOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the Owner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getOwnerStorage() internal pure returns (OwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "s",
      type: "OwnerStorage",
      description: "The OwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### getPendingOwnerStorage

Returns a pointer to the PendingOwner storage struct. Uses inline assembly to access the storage slot defined by PENDING_OWNER_STORAGE_POSITION.

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function getPendingOwnerStorage() internal pure returns (PendingOwnerStorage storage s);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "s",
      type: "PendingOwnerStorage",
      description: "The PendingOwnerStorage struct in storage."
    }
  ]}
  showRequired={false}
/>

---
### owner

Get the address of the owner

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function owner() external view returns (address);`}
</ExpandableCode>

**Returns:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "-",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the owner."
    }
  ]}

/>

---
### transferOwnership

Set the address of the new owner of the contract

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={8}>
{`function transferOwnership(address _newOwner) external;`}

**Parameters:**

<PropertyTable
  properties={[
    {
      name: "_newOwner",
      type: "address",
      description: "The address of the new owner of the contract"
    }
  ]}

      </ExpandableCode>
    </div>

## Usage Example

<ExpandableCode language="solidity" maxLines={20} title="Example Implementation">
{`pragma solidity ^0.8.30;

import {IOwnerTwoStepsFacet} from "@compose/contracts/src/facets/ownership/IOwnerTwoStepsFacet.sol";
import {OwnerTwoStepsFacet} from "@compose/contracts/src/facets/ownership/OwnerTwoStepsFacet.sol";

contract OwnerSetup {
    address public diamondAddress;

    // Assume diamondAddress is set during deployment
    constructor(address _diamondAddress) {
        diamondAddress = _diamondAddress;
    }

    function initiateOwnershipTransfer(address _newOwner) public {
        IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(diamondAddress).transferOwnership(_newOwner);
    }

    function acceptNewOwnership() public {
        IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(diamondAddress).acceptOwnership();
    }

    function getCurrentOwner() public view returns (address) {
        return IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(diamondAddress).owner();
    }

    function getPendingOwner() public view returns (address) {
        return IOwnerTwoStepsFacet(diamondAddress).pendingOwner();
    }
}`}
</ExpandableCode>

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip" title="Best Practice">
- Initialize ownership transfer using `transferOwnership` and confirm with `acceptOwnership` to prevent accidental ownership changes.
- Regularly check the `pendingOwner` to monitor ongoing ownership transfer requests.
- Integrate this facet into your diamond's access control strategy, ensuring critical functions are protected by ownership.
</Callout>

## Security Considerations

<Callout type="warning" title="Security">
Ensure that only the current owner can call `transferOwnership` and `renounceOwnership`. The `acceptOwnership` function should only be callable by the address designated as the pending owner. Direct calls to `getOwnerStorage` and `getPendingOwnerStorage` bypass the public getter functions and should be used with caution, primarily for internal facet logic or advanced debugging.
