## How to Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to Compose. Here are some ways:

1. Look over the existing codebase and see if you can find any bugs, errors or security vulnerabilities. Create an issue about anything you find. This is also a great way to get familiar with the codebase.

2. Look at the code comments in the codebase. See if you can improve them or add more comments to make the code easier to understand.

3. Improve the website documentation by fixing typos, adding examples, creating new content, or clarifying existing content. The documentation files are in the repository under [`website/docs`](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/tree/main/website/docs).

4. Look over the [open issues](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/issues) and see if there are any you can do or help with. Leave comments describing what you want to do and how you want to do it. We'll answer you and assign you to issues so you can start.

5. Look at the [open pull requests](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/pulls) and see if you can help review them or improve them.

6. Open new issues for new features or improvements.

7. If you have general ideas or suggestions or things you want to discuss, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/discussions).
