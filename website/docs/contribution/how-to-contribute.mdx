# Contributing to Compose

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Compose!

Compose is a community developed project. We welcome you and want your help.

## Before Starting

Before contributing, it is important to familiarize yourself with the design of Compose and how it is developed. 

Read the following documentation sections:
1. [Foundations](/docs/foundations)
2. [Compose Design](/docs/contribution/design)

**Browse our [issues](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/issues), [pull requests](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/pulls) and [discussions](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/discussions) to get familiar with the project and find ways to contribute.**

Look at the [ERC20 and ERC721 implementations](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/tree/main/src/token) to see examples of how things are written.

## How to Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to Compose. Here are some ways:

1. Look over the existing codebase and see if you can find any bugs, errors or security vulnerabilities. [Create an issue](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/issues/) about anything you find. This is also a great way to get familiar with the codebase.

2. Look at the code comments in the codebase. See if you can improve them or add more comments to make the code easier to understand.

3. Improve the website documentation by fixing typos, adding examples, creating new content, or clarifying existing content. The documentation files are in the repository under [`website/docs`](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/tree/main/website/docs).

4. Look over the [open issues](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/issues) and see if there are any you can do or help with. Leave comments describing what you want to do and how you want to do it. We'll answer you and assign you to issues so you can start.

5. Look at the [open pull requests](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/pulls) and see if you can help review them or improve them.

6. Open new issues for new features or improvements.

7. If you have general ideas or suggestions or things you want to discuss, please open a [discussion](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/discussions).

8. Look over the existing tests and see if you can add more tests or improve existing tests. Open an issue to describe what you want to do.

9. Have other ideas about how to contribute? Please let us know!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) (version 0.8.30 or higher)
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) (version 1.4.3-stable or higher)
- Git

### Setup Steps
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Compose.git
   cd Compose
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   forge install
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   forge build
   ```
5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   forge test
   ```

## Development Workflow

Once you are assigned to an issue:
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your work
3. Implement your changes
4. Make sure your changes follow the [design of Compose](/docs/contribution/design).
5. Format your code: `forge fmt`
6. Run tests to ensure everything works
7. Submit a pull request
8. We will review it and merge it and/or give you feedback on the work

You can also make new issues to suggest new functionality or work.

### Ideas & Discussions

**We use GitHub Discussions for ideas, debates, and brainstorming!** 

- **Issues** are for actionable items that need to be implemented or fixed
- **Discussions** are for general communication, talking about possibilities, ideas, and exploring concepts

Have an idea for a new feature? Want to discuss project direction? Curious about implementation approaches? Start a discussion in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/discussions) forum. 

This is the perfect place to:
- Share ideas and get community feedback
- Debate different approaches and solutions
- Brainstorm new functionality
- Discuss project direction and philosophy
- Ask "what if" questions
- Explore possibilities before committing to implementation

Once you have a clear idea of what you want to do, [create an issue](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/issues/new). Provide as much data as you can and we will give you the go ahead to start or give more feedback about it.

## Code Style Guide

Follow the [Code Style Guide](/docs/contribution/design/code-style-guide) when contributing code.

### Development Considerations
- Make sure that you understand all code that you use or write
- Gas efficiency is important but how easy the code is to read is more important
- Write secure code
- Write bug free code
- Consider edge cases and potential attack vectors


## Testing

### Required
Before submitting a pull request:
- Format your code: `forge fmt`
- Run all tests: `forge test`
- Update gas snapshots: `forge snapshot`
- Ensure your code follows the [design of Compose](/docs/contribution/design).
- Ensure your code follows the [banned features list](/docs/contribution/design/banned-features).
- Ensure your code follows the coding style in the existing code base.

## Recommended
- Write tests for new functionality 
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Ensure test coverage is maintained or improved

If you make changes to existing functionality, please make sure that the existing tests still work for that functionality and write new tests as necessary that cover the changes you made.

Please note that you can submit a pull request for new functionality **without tests**. Another person can write tests for new functionality.

### When writing tests
- Write comprehensive tests for all functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the existing test patterns in the codebase
- Include gas optimization tests where relevant

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
forge test

# Run tests with verbose output
forge test -vvv

# Run specific test file
forge test --match-path test/ERC20.sol

# Run tests with gas reporting
forge test --gas-report
```

### Test Structure

Tests in Compose follow a specific organizational pattern:

- **Facet Tests** (`test/[Feature]/[Feature]Facet.t.sol`): Test external functions of facets
- **Library Tests** (`test/[Feature]/Lib[Feature].t.sol`): Test internal library functions
- **Test Harnesses** (`test/[Feature]/harnesses/`): Special contracts that expose internal functions for testing
  - Facet harnesses add initialization and helper functions
  - Library harnesses expose internal functions as external

Example structure:
```
test/
├── ERC20/
│   ├── ERC20Facet.t.sol          # Tests for facet external functions
│   ├── LibERC20.t.sol             # Tests for library internal functions
│   └── harnesses/
│       ├── ERC20FacetHarness.sol  # Adds mint() and initialize()
│       └── LibERC20Harness.sol    # Exposes internal functions
```

See [test/README.md](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/blob/main/test/README.md) for detailed testing documentation and patterns.
