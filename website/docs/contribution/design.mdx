# Compose Design

This document contains the guidelines and rules for developing new facets and Solidity libraries in **Compose**.

We focus on building small, independent, and easy-to-understand facets. Each facet is designed to be deployed once, then reused and composed seamlessly with others to form complete smart contract systems.

## Compose is Written to Be Read

The primary design principle of Compose is clarity. Code should be easy to read and understand. This document provides guidelines and rules that promote readability and consistency throughout the codebase.

### Facets are read from top to bottom

Compose facets and libraries are written to be read naturally from top to bottom. Definitions appear before their use, so readers don't need to jump around the file to understand the code.

### Facets are self-contained

Each facet is a complete, standalone unit. Its source file contains all the code it needs, with no imports or dependencies on other files.

Likewise, each Solidity library is also self-contained, with no external imports or dependencies.
