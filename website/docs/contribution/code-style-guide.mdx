description: Code style guidelines for developing Compose facets and libraries
---

This section outlines the code style guidelines for developing new facets and Solidity libraries in **Compose**.

Follow [Compose's design principles](/docs/contribution/design) when contributing code.

Follow the [Solidity feature ban](/docs/contribution/design/banned-solidity-features).

### Naming Conventions

- **Parameter Names:** All parameters for events, errors, and functions must be preceded with an underscore (`_`).
  - Example:
    ```solidity
    event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 indexed _tokenId);
    error ERC20InvalidSender(address _sender);
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount) external {}
    ```
- **Camel Case:** Use camelCase for variable, function, contract, and library names, except for standard uppercase abbreviations (e.g., ERC).
  - Example: `totalSupply`, `LibERC20`, `ERC721Facet`

- **Facets:** Internal function names in facets should be prefixed with `internal` if they otherwise have the same name as an external function in the same facet. Usually, there should be few or no internal functions in facets; repeat code if it improves readability.
- **Libraries:** All functions in libraries use the `internal` visibility specifier. 

### Value Resetting
- Use `delete` to set a value to zero.
  - Example:
    ```solidity
    delete balances[_owner];
    ```

### Avoid Assembly
 - Avoid using assembly if you can. If you can't and you access memory, do it [safely](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/assembly.html#memory-safety), and use `assembly ("memory-safe")`.
   `"memory safe"` tells the Solidity compiler that memory is being used safely so it should not disable optimizations.
   - Example:
     ```solidity
     assembly ("memory-safe") {
         revert(add(reason, 0x20), mload(reason))
     }
     ```

### Formatting
- Format code using the default settings of `forge fmt`. Run `forge fmt` before submitting code.
