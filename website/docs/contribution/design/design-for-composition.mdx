Here are guidelines and rules to understand and use to create composable facets.

We focus on building **small, independent, and easy-to-read facets**. Each facet is deployed once, then reused and combined with other facets to form complete, modular smart contract systems.

## Writing Facets

1. A facet is set of external functions that represent a single unit of self-contained functionality.
2. Each facet is a self-contained, conceptual unit.
3. A facet is designed for all of its functions to be added, not just some of them.
4. The facet is our smallest building block.
5. The source code of a facet should only contain the code (including storage variables, if possible) that it actually uses.
6. Facets are fully self-contained. They do not import anything.


## Writing Facet libraries

1. Facet libraries are self-contained code units. They do not import anything.
2. Each facet should have one corresponding facet library.
3. Facet libraries are used to initialize facets on deployment and during upgrades. 
4. Facet libraries are also used to integrate custom facets with Compose facets.
5. Facet libraries have an initialize function which is used to initialize storage variables during deployment.

## Facets & Libraries

1. Facets and facet libraries should not contain owner/admin authorization checks unless absolutely required or fundamental to the functionality being implemented.


## Extending Facets

1. Every extension of a standard or facet should be implemented as a new facet.
2. A facet should only be extended with a new facet that composes with it.
3. When reusing structs or storage layouts from existing facets or libraries, reuse the original diamond-storage locations and structs, but only include the variables that the new facet actually needs if possible. Of course a reused struct must maintain the same storage layout as an originally defined struct. 
4. Reusing a struct is done by copying it and removing unused variables.
5. Storage structs should be designed so that removable variables (unused by some facets) appear at the end of the struct.
6. Storage structs should also be designed for packed storage (smaller sized variables using the same storage slot).
7. Removing storage variables is done only from the end of a struct. If a variable cannot be removed without breaking layout, it must remain to preserve compatibility.
8.A facet that adds new storage variables must define its own diamond-storage struct.

### Exceptions

There may be reasonable exceptions to these rules. If you believe one applies, please discuss it on  
**– Discord:** https://discord.gg/DCBD2UKbxc  
**– GitHub Issues:** https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/issues  
**– GitHub Discussions:** https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/discussions

For example, `ERC721EnumerableFacet` does not extend `ERC721Facet` because enumeration requires re-implementing transfer and mint/burn logic, making it incompatible with `ERC721Facet`.

*** 

This level of composability strikes the right balance: it enables highly organized, modular, and understandable onchain smart contract systems.
