title: Facets Are Self-Contained
description: Each facet is a complete, standalone unit.

Each facet is a complete, standalone unit. Its source file contains all the code it needs, with no imports or dependencies on other files.

Likewise, each Solidity library is also self-contained, with no external imports or dependencies.
