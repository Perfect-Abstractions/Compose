title: Compose Is Written to Be Read
description: Compose is written to be read by other developers.

The primary design principle of Compose is **clarity**. Code should be easy to read and understand. 

The design of Compose includes guidelines and rules that promote readability and consistency throughout the codebase.

Though many people may contribute to the Compose standard library of facets and libraries, it should look like it was written by one person.

***

### Facets Are Self-Contained

Each facet is a complete, standalone unit. Its source file contains all the code it needs, with no imports or dependencies on other files.

Likewise, each Solidity library is also self-contained, with no external imports or dependencies.

***

### Facets Are Read from Top to Bottom

Compose facets and libraries are written to be read naturally from top to bottom. 

Definitions appear before their use, so readers don't need to jump around the file to understand the code.
