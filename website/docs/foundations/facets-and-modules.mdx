description: Learn how facets and modules work together through shared storage to build composable systems.

Compose uses two complementary patterns for smart contract development:

### Facets (Complete Implementations)

**Facets** are standalone contracts that contain all the logic needed to implement specific functionality. They're designed to be:

- **Self-contained**: All code needed for the feature is in one file
- **Readable top-to-bottom**: No jumping between files (or within the same file) to understand the logic
- **Deployed once**: Reused across multiple diamonds on-chain
- **Deployed everywhere**: Our facets will be deployed on many blockchains at the same addresses

**Example**: `ERC20Facet.sol` contains the complete ERC-20 token implementation.

### Modules (Helper Functions)

**Solidity modules help developers integrate their custom facets with Compose's facets. They:

- **Provide helper functions**: Reusable internal functions for custom facets
- **Access shared storage**: Work with the same storage layout as their corresponding facet
- **Enable composition**: Allow custom facets to interact with Compose functionality
- **Initializes Deployment**: Used to set variables when deploying diamonds

**Example**: `ERC20Mod.sol` provides helper functions to interact with ERC-20 storage from custom facets.

### The Key Insight: Shared Storage

**Both facets and modules access the SAME storage in your diamond.** When `ERC721Facet` and `ERC721Mod` both define identical storage at `keccak256("compose.erc721")`, they're reading and writing the same data. This is how your custom facets can extend Compose functionality without inheritance.

### When to Use Each

**Use a facet when you want:**

- The complete, standard implementation (e.g., full ERC-20 functionality)
- To reuse it (on-chain) across multiple diamonds
- A verified, audited implementation

**Use a module when you're:**

- Building a custom facet that needs to interact with Compose features
- Extending standard functionality with custom logic
- Initializing storage variables during diamond deployment

## Available Facets & Modules

Look in the [src directory](https://github.com/Perfect-Abstractions/Compose/tree/main/src) to see the currently provided functionality, facets and modules.
