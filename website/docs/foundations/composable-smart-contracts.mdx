title: Composable Smart Contracts
description: Compose smart contracts are designed to be composable.
---

The word **"composable"** means *able to be combined with other parts to form a whole*. 

In **Compose**, facets are designed to be **composable** — they're built to interoperate seamlessly with other facets inside the same diamond.

Composable design makes it possible to **mix, match, and reuse** smart contract logic across many projects — without modifying or redeploying source code. It turns smart contracts into reusable building blocks.

:::tip[Key Insight]
Onchain facets are the **building blocks** of Compose.
:::

**Examples of composition:**
1. `ERC20Facet`, `ERC20PermitFacet` and `ERC20BridgableFacet`can be combined in a single diamond to create a fully featured ERC-20 token.
2. Facets `ERC721Facet`, `ERC721MetadataFacet`, `ERC721RoyaltyFacet` can be composed to build an ERC-721 NFT contract.

### Why This Matters

Traditional smart contract libraries extend functionality through **inheritance at the source-code level**, for example:

```Solidity
contract ERC20Permit is ERC20 { ... }
```

This approach tightly couples code and forces every variant to be redeployed as a new contract.

**Compose changes that.**

Instead of inheritance, it uses **onchain composition** — combining existing deployed facets inside a diamond.

This reduces duplication, improves upgradeability, and makes smart contract systems more flexible and maintainable.
