<DocSubtitle>
**Compose takes a different approach.**

Compose provides a set of **reusable on-chain contracts** that already exist on blockchains. You don't need to deploy or manage them yourself. The heavy lifting has been done for you.
</DocSubtitle>

## Why This Matters

Traditionally, you would extend functionality through **inheritance at the source-code level**, for example:

```Solidity
contract ERC20Permit is ERC20 { ... }
```

This approach tightly couples code and forces every variant to be redeployed as a new contract, resulting in the same code being duplicated and deployed across countless projects. 

**Compose changes that!**

Instead of inheritance, it uses **on-chain composition** — combining existing deployed facets and your own custom facets inside a single diamond.

This reduces duplication, improves upgradeability, and makes smart contract systems more flexible and maintainable. 

For your next project, instead of deploying new contracts, simply **use the existing onchain contracts** provided by Compose.


:::tip[Key Insight]
Compose is a general purpose **on-chain** smart contract library.

:::info[In Development]
Compose is still in early development, and its smart contracts haven't been deployed yet.
We're actively building—and if this vision excites you, we'd love for you to join us.
