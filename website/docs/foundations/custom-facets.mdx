title: "Custom Functionality: Compose Your Own Facets"
description: "Build your own facets that work seamlessly with existing Compose Functionality."

import Callout from '@site/src/components/ui/Callout';

Many projects need custom functionality beyond the standard facets.  
Compose is designed for this — you can build and integrate your own facets that work seamlessly alongside existing Compose facets.

Compose provides Solidity modules that expose the same storage layouts and internal logic used by its on-chain facets. This lets your custom facets share data and interact directly with Compose's reusable facets.

**Example: Adding Game Logic to ERC-721**

Suppose you're building an on-chain game and want to include the `ERC721Facet` in your diamond.
You can add your own `GameNFTFacet` that extends functionality while still sharing the same ERC-721 storage through `ERC721Mod`:

```Solidity
/**
 * Your custom facet integrates with Compose using Modules
 */
import "compose/ERC721Mod" as ERC721Mod;

contract GameNFTFacet {
    function mintWithGameLogic(address player, uint256 tokenId) external {
        /**
         * Your custom game logic
         */
        require(playerHasEnoughPoints(player), "Not enough points");
        
        /**
         * Use ERC721Mod to mint - this modifies the SAME storage
         * that ERC721Facet uses for balanceOf(), ownerOf(), etc.
         */
        ERC721Mod.mint(player, tokenId);
        
        /**
         * Now the player owns this NFT and can use standard
         * ERC721Facet.transferFrom() to transfer it!
         */
        updatePlayerStats(player);
    }
}
```
<Callout type="tip" title="Key Insight">
Your custom `GameNFTFacet` and the standard `ERC721Facet` both operate on the **same storage** within your diamond. This shared-storage architecture is what makes composition possible.

Compose is still in early development and currently available only to contributors.
It is not **production-ready** — use it in test or development environments only.
