A **diamond contract** is a smart contract that is made up of multiple parts instead of one large block of code. The diamond exists at **one address** and holds **all of the contract's storage**, but it uses separate smart contracts called **facets** to provide its functionality.

Users interact only with the **diamond**, but the diamond's features come from its **facets**. Each facet provides a small, focused set of functions, and the diamond uses those functions to perform its actions. 

Because facets can be added, replaced, or removed, a diamond can grow and evolve over time **without changing its address** and without redeploying the entire system.

<Callout type="note" title="In Simple Terms">
A diamond contract is a smart contract made from multiple small building blocks (facets), allowing it to be flexible, organized, and able to grow over time.
</Callout>

A diamond has:
- One address
- Its own data storage
- Multiple facets providing functionality

Below is a diagram showing a diamond with multiple facets.

A Diamond lets you:

- Put unlimited functionality under **one address**
- Organize logic into small, reusable facets
- Create and maintain storage data using facets.
- Add, replace, or remove functionality after deployment
- Inspect functionality that exists in a diamond


[ERC-2535 Diamonds](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535) is the standard that defines how diamond contracts work.
   
A major part of Compose is providing an easy way to deploy diamonds using Compose facets and custom facets.

### Compose with a Standard Library of Facets

Compose has a **standard library of facets** designed to be:

- Small  
- Secure
- Focused  
- Reusable  
- Easy to read  
- Safe to combine  

Compose users assemble a contract system by selecting the facets they want:

```txt
[ERC20Facet] + [PermitFacet] + [BurnableFacet] → Custom ERC-20

[ERC721Facet] + [MetadataFacet] + [RoyaltyFacet] → Custom NFT

[GovernanceFacet] + [VotingFacet] → Governance System
