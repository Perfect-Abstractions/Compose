You might be wondering: **How can I create a new project without deploying new smart contracts?**

How does Compose make it possible to build new systems from existing onchain contracts?

The answer lies in Compose's smart contract architecture, which is based on [diamond contracts](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535).

A diamond contract is a simple, tiny contract that **uses the code of other onchain contracts** called **facets**. Each diamond uses the code of other contracts (facets) to create and maintain its storage data.

Below is a diagram showing a diamond connected to multiple facets that provide its functionality.

When you use Compose, you *do* deploy new contracts—but only the small diamond contract that ties together existing onchain facets.

Let's look at a simple example.

Suppose you want to create a new ERC-20 token that supports gasless approvals (permit) and cross-chain bridging.

With Compose, you can:

1. **Select the facets you need** – for example, `ERC20Facet`, `ERC20PermitFacet`, and `ERC20BridgableFacet`.
2. **Provide initialization data** – such as the token name, symbol, and total supply.
3. **Deploy your diamond** – which initializes your ERC-20 token and connects it to the chosen facets.

:::tip[Key Insight]
Many diamond contracts can be deployed that **reuse the same onchain facets**.
