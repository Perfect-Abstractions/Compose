You might be wondering: **How can I create a new project without deploying new smart contracts?**

The answer lies in Compose's smart contract architecture, which is based on [diamond contracts](/docs/foundations/diamond-contracts).

## Understanding Reusability

A diamond contract is a simple, small proxy contract that **delegates to the code of other on-chain contracts** called **facets**. Each diamond uses the code of other contracts (facets) to execute logic and maintain its storage data.

When you use Compose, you *do* deploy a new contract, this small contract is called a **diamond**.

## What You're NOT Deploying

When you create a new diamond, you avoid redeploying:

- Existing standard functionality such as 
  - `ERC20Facet`
  - `ERC20PermitFacet`
  - `ERC721Facet`
  - `OwnerFacet`
  - `AccessControlFacet`
  - etc.

Instead, you deploy:

- A lightweight diamond contract
- Your unique initialization data (`name`, `symbol`, `supply`)
- Configuration linking to existing facet addresses

## Example

Suppose you want to create a new ERC-20 token that supports gasless approvals (permit) and cross-chain bridging.

With Compose, you:

1. **Select existing facets**: `ERC20Facet`, `ERC20PermitFacet`, and `ERC20BridgeableFacet` are already deployed on-chain
2. **Provide initialization data**: your token's name, symbol, and total supply
3. **Deploy your diamond**: a small proxy contract that references the facet addresses and logic

## The Power of Reusability

**One facet, thousands of projects:**

If 1,000 projects use the same `ERC20Facet`:
- That's **999 deployments saved**
- **Millions in gas costs avoided**
- **1,000 projects** benefit from the same audited, battle-tested code

Many diamond contracts can be deployed that **reuse the same on-chain facets**.

<Callout type="tip" title="Key Insight">
Each diamond manages **its own storage data** by using the code from facets.
</Callout>



## Benefits of Reusable Facets

1. **Lower Deployment Costs**: Deploy only a small proxy instead of thousands of lines of logic
2. **Shared Security Audits**: When a facet is audited, all diamonds using it benefit
3. **Consistent Behavior**: Same code means same behavior across all implementations
