title: Onchain Smart Contracts
description: Compose provides a set of reusable on-chain contracts that already exist on blockchains
---

Traditional smart contract libraries give you source code that you must modify, extend, and deploy yourself to one or more blockchains.

**Compose takes a different approach.**

Compose provides a set of **reusable on-chain contracts** that already exist on blockchains—you don't need to deploy or manage them yourself. The heavy lifting has been done.

For your next project, instead of deploying new contracts, simply **use the existing onchain contracts** provided by Compose.


:::tip[Key Insight]
Compose is a general purpose **onchain** smart contract library.

:::info[In Development]
Compose is still in early development, and its smart contracts haven't been deployed yet.
We're actively building—and if this vision excites you, we'd love for you to join us.
