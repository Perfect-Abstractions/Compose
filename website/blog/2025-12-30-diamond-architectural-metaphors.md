> The following sections use metaphors to clarify diamond architectural intent and design philosophy.

## Modularity

Where monolithic contracts blur responsibility, diamonds draw sharp edges.
Each facet isolates a single concern, reducing complexity through separation.
Bound by a single address and storage, the result is a structured, unified whole.

A diamond is not defined by excess, but by intention.
Every facet exists for a reason, cut precisely to serve the whole.
This standard favors deliberate structure over accidental complexity, ensuring that each function has a clear place and purpose.

## Immutable Functions

To support flawless architecture, this standard discourages immutable functions. Like imperfections within a diamond, they cloud structural clarity and cannot be polished away.

## Immutable Diamonds

An immutable diamond is cut once, with no margin for error.
Every facet must be placed with intention, for no edge can be reworked after the stone is set.
Its strength comes from certainty, not change.

Immutability improves clarity.
When no future changes are possible, the design is complete.
Nothing is deferred, and nothing is concealed behind upgrade intent.

An immutable diamond is still modular.
Its facets are cut separately, inspected individually, and set only once.
Immutability does not remove structure — it freezes a structure already proven.

True permanence is chosen, not imposed.
A diamond may be set forever, but only after it has been examined, and graded.
This standard preserves the freedom to refine before committing to final form.

## Upgrades

Software, like a rough stone, requires shaping. 
This standard grants the freedom to polish and refine, turning a raw idea into a flawless diamond through the iterative process of upgrades.

A diamond is not perfected in a single strike.
It is shaped through measured cuts, evaluated under light, and refined over time.
This standard embraces evolution, allowing systems to improve without disturbing what already shines.

## Single Contract Address

Behind many facets stands a solitary, enduring interface. It presents a singular, cohesive identity to the world, regardless of the depth of logic beneath the surface.

## Composability

Deployed facets may be reused, recombined, and set into new designs.
From a shared library of facets, countless diamonds may emerge — distinct in purpose, consistent in form.
Reuse strengthens the ecosystem, as proven facets bring their clarity wherever they are set.

## Transparency 

True value requires transparency. Unlike opaque proxies that hide their functions, this standard ensures the architecture remains crystal clear, granting users an unobstructed view of its composition.

A diamond is judged by how it handles light. This standard ensures the architecture remains pure, allowing the light of public scrutiny to pass through every facet without obstruction or distortion.

Light reveals flaws before it reveals brilliance.
By making structure explicit and changes observable, this standard invites scrutiny as a form of strength, not risk.
Trust emerges not from obscurity, but from clarity.

## Durability

Trends fade, tooling changes, but structure endures.
A diamond that is well cut today will remain sound tomorrow.
This standard aims not for novelty, but for designs that withstand time, upgrades, and inspection.
